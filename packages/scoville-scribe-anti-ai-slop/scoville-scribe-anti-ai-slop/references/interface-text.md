or API errors, notifications, product-generated email, accessibility text, and
metadata values.

## Avoid generic interface filler

Apply these checks to the wording without inventing or changing product behavior:

- Replace vague actions such as `Let's go`, `Unlock`, or `Get started` with the
  supported result when the generic label conceals what the control does. Keep
  established canonical labels and genuine onboarding actions when they fit.
- Remove unearned reassurance such as `seamless`, `effortless`, `secure`, or
  `you're all set` when the current state does not support it. A pending action
  is not a completed action.
- Keep routine success, empty, loading, and error states factual. Avoid canned
  celebration, apologies, emoji, and exclamation marks when they obscure the
  state or recovery. Respect an established product voice where it remains clear.
- Remove helper text that merely repeats the label. Retain constraints, format
  examples, consequences, and recovery instructions that affect the next action.
- Do not turn an error into a marketing message or a vague `Something went
  wrong` when a safe, verified, useful problem description is available. Never
  expose sensitive internals merely to make the message more specific.

Judge each pattern by clarity and verified behavior, not by presumed authorship.
Do not add humor or rewrite canonical terms to manufacture a human voice.

## Inspect the relevant project state

Use the smallest targeted inspection that can answer the text decision. Check,
as applicable:

- the requested final behavior and product requirements;
- the affected component, command, state transition, or returned error;
- the glossary, design system, string catalog, and localization rules;
- shared strings and established terms on the same or neighboring surface;
- documentation only where it agrees with product behavior;
- runtime formatting, accessibility, and rendered-space constraints.

Do not run a repository-wide terminology rewrite for one surface. If behavior,
terminology, and documentation disagree materially, report the exact conflict.
Do not make a prose choice stand in for a product decision.

## Keep concepts and terms aligned

Use one canonical term family for one concept. Inflection, grammatical case,
pluralization, and locale-specific forms may differ. Similar-looking concepts
may require different terms. Removing a membership, for example, is not the
same operation as deleting the person's account.

When sources agree on meaning, prefer an explicit product requirement, then a
maintained glossary, a shared string for the same component and state, relevant
neighboring usage, and finally documentation that matches behavior.

Do not vary a product term for rhythm. Search likely variants when auditing
consistency, then verify the concept behind each occurrence before changing it.

## Describe the user-relevant state

State what is true in the supported state represented by the artifact. Describe
a requested final state only when it ships with the behavior and the owning
engineering workflow verifies it before completion or publication. Omit
internal causes, discarded tools, issue chronology, and unreleased alternatives.

Mention an older state only when users could have encountered it and need that
history to migrate, understand a deprecation, avoid harm, or recover from a
specific failure. Put ordinary release history in release or migration text,
not in routine labels, help, or empty states.

## Match wording to behavior

Apply the Core explanatory-substance check to help and behavior-bound
procedures. A correct control name alone does not explain its purpose, required
input, or the criterion for checking a result. Let surrounding context supply
these when it already does, without expanding every label into instructions.

- Name an action by its actual result. `Save`, `Apply`, `Create`, `Add`,
  `Remove`, `Delete`, `Upload`, and `Transfer` are not interchangeable.
- Use the same concept term in an action, its status, and its confirmation.
- Name the affected object in destructive actions and confirmations.
- In an error, state the problem and an available next action. Do not imply a
  prior action unless verified, or offer retry unless it is available and safe.
- Promise success, duration, reversibility, privacy, or support only when
  verified product behavior supports it.
- Include only information that changes understanding, choice, or next action.
- Do not inherit humor from the agent's conversational voice. Use humor only
  when the user requests it or the established product voice calls for it on
  this surface and in this state. Never let humor obscure the state, available
  action, consequence, or material risk.

## Preserve runtime and localization contracts

During an edit, preserve string keys and placeholder names, types, and escaping.
Do not add, drop, or duplicate occurrences silently. Change an occurrence count
only when the wording requires it and the schema accepts it. Preserve ICU `plural`, `select`,
`selectordinal`, and required `other` branches; markup; interpolation boundaries;
access-key syntax; shortcuts; command literals; and accessibility relationships
unless the task changes that contract. Runtime and intentional template placeholders are not drafting markers.

During localization, preserve lookup keys, argument names and types, selector
meaning, escaping, schema, and required fallback behavior. Allow the locale to
add required plural or ordinal branches, reorder, repeat, or omit an argument
where the message remains true, choose a different unique access key, and change
sentence structure or wrapping. Translate complete messages and keep the locale's
canonical term family consistent.

## Cover non-visible interface text

Accessible names must describe purpose or action, not only icon shape or screen
position. When a control has a visible text label, its accessible name must
contain that text, preferably at the start. It may add necessary context but
must not replace the visible wording.

Describe only known content in alt text, previews, metadata, and structured
data. Preserve structured-data keys, types, and schema when editing its
human-language values. Do not infer visual details, authorship, product
features, or search claims from a filename or development note. Status messages
must expose meaningful state changes when the interface relies on them.

## Verify in context

Where the artifact permits it:

1. Re-run the relevant term search for same-concept consistency.
2. Compare runtime tokens and message branches with the original.
3. Exercise the action or state and compare wording with the result.
4. Inspect rendering, wrapping, keyboard use, and accessible name.
5. Check every materially different changed ICU or state branch and at least one
   representative variable expansion.

When Scoville UI is also active, reuse its rendered layout and interaction
evidence instead of repeating the same inspection. Scribe still verifies the
wording, tokens, branches, and meaning.

A spelling or word-list check does not verify interface text.
