# Scoville Plan

A useful plan lets you pick up the work again without reconstructing the whole
conversation. It says what is active, which decisions apply and what needs to
happen next. If maintaining the plan becomes most of the work, the structure
is getting in the way.

Scoville Plan keeps Plans, Work Items and Decisions in the repository. Use it
when work spans dependent outcomes, needs explicit decisions or must survive
interruption. It preserves the existing planning owner and keeps completion
tied to an observed result, rather than the presence of a file or a checked box.
Small reversible changes usually need no durable Plan.

## Why "Scoville"?

The family is named for useful signal that remains detectable after dilution.
In Plan, that means keeping the direction of the work recoverable across sessions.

## Companion app

The optional Scoville Plan Viewer turns the repository records into a compact,
read-only desktop overview. Point it at a project containing
`PROJECT_INDEX.md`, `docs/plans`, and `docs/decisions` to see the active Plan
point, completed and upcoming work, paused, blocked, or cancelled steps, and
the current and historical Decisions. It rereads visible projects every four
seconds while the window is active, so edits made by an agent or editor appear
without a second tracking system.

[Download the current release](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/releases/latest)
for Windows x64, macOS Apple Silicon or Intel, and Linux x64. Windows offers a
portable EXE and installers; macOS offers DMGs and zipped apps; Linux offers a
portable binary, AppImage, DEB, and RPM packages.

The saved project list is one `scoville-plan-viewer.xml` file beside a portable
application. Installed copies in read-only system folders use the platform user
configuration directory for the same XML file. Removing a project from the
Viewer never changes its repository.

## How to use

Name Scoville Plan when the work needs durable repository state:

```text
Use Scoville Plan to create a repository-owned implementation Plan for migrating the billing schema, updating consumers, and rolling out safely. Preserve any existing planning owner and do not implement the work.
```

```text
Use Scoville Plan to resume the active Plan. Reconcile the current Work Item with observed repository state, update evidence and the next action, then continue only the authorized work.
```

```text
Use Scoville Plan to audit the existing Plan and Decision records for lifecycle, dependency, blocker, and completion-evidence defects. Do not change files.
```

Explicit `$scoville-plan` invocation also works on hosts that support named
Skill invocation.

## Compatibility

Any Agent Skills host with read and write access to the repository's PROJECT_INDEX.md, docs/plans and docs/decisions. Direct Markdown and YAML edits only; requires no planning CLI, MCP server, database or network. Optional read-only selector and structural validator need Python 3. Developed for Codex and Claude Code; other hosts untested.

## Install

### Install this Skill

In a local Codex or Claude Code session, ask:

```text
Install this Agent Skill for all my projects from this exact package directory:
https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/tree/main/scoville-plan
Preserve existing customizations and ask before overwriting conflicting files.
Report the installed location and whether the host discovers the Skill.
```

The agent needs source access and permission to write to its personal Skills
location. Manual fallback: [Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills)
or [Claude Code Skills guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

Install only the linked package for the focused option.

### Install the complete Scoville suite

## What it enforces

- **One planning owner.** Existing repository instructions and records stay authoritative.
- **Records a worker can use.** Each fact has one owner. Goals describe the current target, Work Items describe resumable outcomes, and numbered Steps name the actual work.
- **Check before starting.** Compare the next item with current sources and relevant completed work. Repair stale assumptions before executing them.
- **One active item.** The Plan names the current work and its first unfinished action.
- **Durable changes of direction.** Queue additions without losing current work. Preserve explicit stops, priorities and requested returns after a redirect.
- **Evidence before completion.** A file and a green structure check do not prove that the requested result works.
- **Explicit decisions.** Record human choices without asking twice. Keep inferred choices proposed until accepted.
- **No planning for the sake of planning.** Editing the Plan changes its records directly. It does not create another Work Item to maintain them.

When Workflow is active, Steps expose the scope and boundaries needed for
dispatch. The coordinator chooses the route. Plan can retain an explicit
executor choice, but does not quietly turn a small-looking edit into low-risk work.

The complete contract, including dispatch projections and direct-edit limits,
is in [SKILL.md](scoville-plan/SKILL.md).

## How it works

The Skill first resolves the existing planning owner and whether durable state
is justified. It then loads only the format and lifecycle guidance required for
the requested operation, edits the native `format_version: 1` Markdown/YAML
records directly, and checks links and invariants. Optional standard-library
Python helpers provide structural validation and a deterministic read-only
projection containing only the selected Plan direction, Work Item, direct
dependency statuses, and referenced Decisions. The profile remains usable
without them or without the Skill installed.

Routine updates read the relevant complete blocks without printing unrelated
history. Full-file change detection and complete structural checks remain in
place. Completed records stay in their original Plans, available when needed.

## How it was developed

Plan developed through real project records and the difficulty of picking work
up again. The records need to say what is active, which decisions apply and
what remains to be done. More structure is useful only while it makes those
answers easier to recover.

I compare complete task histories with the records agents read and change.
That shows unnecessary rereading, stale state and planning that consumes time
without moving the work forward. Earlier
[optimization work](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/blob/6efa0c0c3ee566a5874206a1709c8079758f6108/CHANGELOG.md)
explored shorter instructions and selective loading. Later changes narrowed
routine reads while retaining checks for changed records and missing
instructions.

## Scoville family

Each Skill works independently. Combine only the concerns the task actually
needs:

- [Brainstorm](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-brainstorm) explores materially different mechanisms before selection.
- [Research](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-research) turns web, GitHub, and scholarly evidence into a decision-ready, claim-traceable result.
- [Code](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-code-anti-ai-slop) owns engineering scope, implementation, risk, and validation.
- [Design](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-design-anti-ai-slop) owns visual definition, art direction, design systems, critique, and repair.
- [UI](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-ui-anti-ai-slop) owns framework-aligned implementation, interface mechanics, accessibility, and rendered evidence, with a standalone design fallback.
- [WordPress UI Backend](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-wordpress-ui-backend-anti-ai-slop) owns plugin-owned WordPress admin interfaces, platform components, spacing, accessibility and internationalization.
- [Scribe](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-scribe-anti-ai-slop) owns wording, terminology, factual meaning, and source fidelity.
- [Plan](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan) owns durable Plans, Work Items, Decisions, and lifecycle state.
- [Handoff](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-handoff) transfers active work to another agent or session.
- [Workflow Codex](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite) coordinates explicit Plan execution through native Codex project tasks.
