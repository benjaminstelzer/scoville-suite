# Scoville Plan

Work spread across conversations is easy to lose. A task may be marked done
without evidence, a decision may disappear into chat, or the next session may
have to reconstruct the project before making one change.

Scoville Plan keeps direction, Work Items and Decisions in the repository.
It makes the current work and next action recoverable while preserving the
project's existing planning owner. Use it for dependent work and long-running
projects, not to turn a small reversible edit into paperwork.

## How it works

- Resolve the existing planning owner and whether durable records are needed.
- Read the relevant Plan, Work Item and Decisions, then edit Markdown and YAML directly.
- Check the next item against current sources before starting it. Keep one current item and an explicit next action.
- Record evidence before completion and preserve accepted decisions and completed history.
- Use optional read-only helpers for structural validation and selected-work projections. Records remain usable without them.

## What it enforces

- **One planning owner.** Existing repository instructions and records stay authoritative.
- **Records a worker can use.** Each fact has one owner. Goals describe the current target, Work Items describe resumable outcomes, and numbered Steps name the actual work.
- **Check before starting.** Compare the next item with current sources and relevant completed work. Repair stale assumptions before executing them.
- **One active item.** The Plan names the current work and its first unfinished action.
- **Durable changes of direction.** Queue additions without losing current work. Preserve explicit stops, priorities and requested returns after a redirect.
- **Evidence before completion.** A file and a green structure check do not prove that the requested result works.
- **Explicit decisions.** Record human choices without asking twice. Keep inferred choices proposed until accepted.
- **No planning for the sake of planning.** Editing the Plan changes its records directly. It does not create another Work Item to maintain them.

- When Workflow is active, Steps expose the scope and boundaries needed for dispatch. The coordinator chooses the route. Plan can retain an explicit executor choice, but does not quietly turn a small-looking edit into low-risk work.

- The complete contract, including dispatch projections and direct-edit limits, is in [SKILL.md](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/blob/main/scoville-plan/SKILL.md).

## What it costs

- Maintaining records adds reading, writing and validation overhead.
- A structurally valid Plan does not prove that its implementation works. Small tasks may not need one.

## How it was developed

- Plan developed through real project records and the difficulty of picking work up again.
- The records need to say what is active, which decisions apply and what remains to be done.
- More structure is useful only while it makes those answers easier to recover.
- Real-project histories are analyzed alongside results to identify failures and unnecessary context use.
- Targeted simulation and optimization workflows inform revisions. Changes are retained only when the required behavior survives.

## Compatibility

Any Agent Skills host with read and write access to the repository's PROJECT_INDEX.md, docs/plans and docs/decisions. Direct Markdown and YAML edits only; requires no planning CLI, MCP server, database or network. Optional read-only selector and structural validator need Python 3. Developed for Codex and Claude Code; other hosts untested.

## Install

### Install this Skill

In a local Codex or Claude Code session, ask:

```text
Install this Agent Skill for all my projects from this exact package directory:
https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/tree/main/scoville-plan
Preserve existing customizations and ask before overwriting conflicting files.
Report the installed location and whether the host discovers the Skill.
```

The agent needs source access and permission to write to its personal Skills
location. Manual fallback: [Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills)
or [Claude Code Skills guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

Install only the linked package for the focused option.

### Install the complete Scoville suite

Get the complete suite from the
[Scoville Suite monorepo](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite).
Install its released Skill packages, not development templates.

## How to use

Name Scoville Plan when the work needs durable repository state:

```text
Use Scoville Plan to create a repository-owned implementation Plan for migrating the billing schema, updating consumers, and rolling out safely. Preserve any existing planning owner and do not implement the work.
```

```text
Use Scoville Plan to resume the active Plan. Reconcile the current Work Item with observed repository state, update evidence and the next action, then continue only the authorized work.
```

```text
Use Scoville Plan to audit the existing Plan and Decision records for lifecycle, dependency, blocker, and completion-evidence defects. Do not change files.
```

Explicit `$scoville-plan` invocation also works on hosts that support named
Skill invocation.

### Companion app

The optional Scoville Plan Viewer turns the repository records into a compact,
read-only desktop overview. Point it at a project containing
`PROJECT_INDEX.md`, `docs/plans`, and `docs/decisions` to see the active Plan
point, completed and upcoming work, paused, blocked, or cancelled steps, and
the current and historical Decisions. It rereads visible projects every four
seconds while the window is active, so edits made by an agent or editor appear
without a second tracking system.

[Download the current release](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-plan/releases/latest)
for Windows x64, macOS Apple Silicon or Intel, and Linux x64. Windows offers a
portable EXE and installers; macOS offers DMGs and zipped apps; Linux offers a
portable binary, AppImage, DEB, and RPM packages.

The saved project list is one `scoville-plan-viewer.xml` file beside a portable
application. Installed copies in read-only system folders use the platform user
configuration directory for the same XML file. Removing a project from the
Viewer never changes its repository.
