# Scoville Code Anti-AI-Slop

A coding agent can finish the wrong thing quite thoroughly. The tests are green,
the report sounds certain, but the behavior you asked for is still missing.

Scoville Code is the engineering foundation of the suite. It connects the
requested result, the existing implementation and the evidence that the change
works. The agent must understand the cause and respect the project's architecture,
not simply produce a plausible patch. Use it to develop, diagnose, review or
remove code without turning every small change into a full audit.

## How it works

- Establish the observable outcome, responsible code, introduced risks and cheapest decisive check before substantial editing.
- Read the owner and relevant callers, contracts and tests. Expand only when the evidence points elsewhere.
- Fix the cause in the existing implementation. Avoid parallel paths, speculative abstractions and unrelated cleanup.
- Test the changed behavior. A successful build or mocked integration proves only what it exercised.
- Investigate failed checks without weakening them. After two unsuccessful corrections of the same cause, reassess the approach.
- Inspect the complete change and report observed results and remaining gaps. Stop checking when further evidence would not change the decision.

## What it enforces

- **Outcome over ceremony.** Plans, tests, docs, and refactors support the
  requested behavior. Producing them is not completion by itself.
- **Canonical ownership.** The change fits the project's existing architecture,
  records, terminology, and workflow instead of creating a second owner.
- **Proportionate risk.** Small reversible work stays small. Destructive,
  public-facing, security, data, or release work receives stronger gates.
- **Evidence before claims.** Checks prove only what they observed. A failed
  tool is not silently promoted to a passing product.
- **Root-cause correction.** The agent changes approach after repeated failure
  instead of repeating the same unsuccessful fix.
- **Navigable code structure.** Existing work follows project conventions and
  surrounding module boundaries. Greenfield work starts with the smallest
  coherent responsibility-based layout. A 2,000-line default ceiling remains
  a backstop with concrete exceptions, never an architecture target.
- **Material questions only.** It asks when a missing choice changes behavior,
  authority, cost, reversibility, or scope, not for details the code settles.
- **Complete handoff.** The final report names changed behavior, relevant
  validation, unresolved failures, and relevant repository state.

## What it costs

- Source inspection and checks use more tokens and time than an immediate patch.

## How it was developed

- Developed through real engineering tasks and analysis of their complete histories.
- Turned wrong-cause fixes, missed outcomes and repeated checks into instruction changes and regression cases.
- Combined targeted simulations with optimization workflows, including SkillOpt.
- Retained shorter instructions only when required behavior survived the tests.

## Compatibility

Any Agent Skills host that can read references/ and run the project's own build, test and check commands in a shell. Version control optional. No bundled scripts, no network access required. Developed for Codex and Claude Code; other hosts untested.

This Skill works on its own. Other Scoville Skills are optional and handle
only their own concerns when available and applicable.

## Install

### Install this Skill

This standalone package works independently. Ask your compatible agent host:

```text
Install this Skill for all my projects from this exact package directory:
https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-code-anti-ai-slop/tree/main/scoville-code-anti-ai-slop
Preserve personal settings and unrelated Skills. Report the installed location
and whether the host discovers the Skill.
```

The host needs permission to write to its Skills directory. See the
[Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills) or the
[Claude Code Skills guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
for host-specific locations.

### Install the complete Scoville suite

Get the complete suite from the
[Scoville Suite monorepo](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite).
Install its released Skill packages, not development templates.

## How to use

```text
Use Scoville Code to analyze this codebase for correctness, ownership and missing validation. Report prioritized findings.
```

```text
Analyze this codebase for defects and hidden failure paths. Support findings with code evidence and keep the analysis read-only.
