# Scoville Handoff

The next session needs enough information to continue, not another transcript.
A long summary can still miss the current blocker, unfinished changes or the
reason an earlier approach failed.

Scoville Handoff produces one compact continuation prompt with the objective,
current state, authority and next safe action. It preserves the facts needed
to resume without quietly advancing or completing the work.

## How it works

- Read the named task sources with bounded recovery when a read is incomplete.
- Capture decisions, ownership, evidence, blockers and hazards without secrets.
- Organize the result into Receiver Instructions, Objective, State and Resume Steps.
- Compare the prompt against the captured facts and return one copy-ready block.
- The receiver checks current state before acting. A tight limit removes repetition before necessary facts.

## What it enforces

- **Explicit transfer only.** Ordinary summaries and context reduction do not
  produce a handoff artifact.
- **One receiver contract.** Every handoff contains Receiver Instructions,
  Objective, State, and Resume Steps in one copy-ready block.
- **Facts instead of pointers.** Named sources are read with targeted recovery
  for truncation or a transient failure, within explicit user limits. Their material
  facts enter the artifact so the receiver has them when resuming.
- **Authority and ownership survive.** Commit, publication, destructive-action,
  external-effect, file-owner, and dirty-tree boundaries stay explicit.
- **Unknown stays unknown.** Running or unobserved work never becomes a success
  claim, and secret values never enter the handoff.
- **The receiver can act.** Step 1 is the next safe action. The final step names
  an observable completion result.
- **Transfer does not advance the task.** Handoff reads the named state but does
  not edit, test, publish, or otherwise improve it on the way out.

## What it costs

- Preparing a reliable handoff requires additional reading and tokens.
- Missing facts cannot be recovered from an empty record. If required facts cannot fit, the limit must be resolved.
- Ordinary summaries, low context and ending a session do not activate this Skill.

## How it was developed

- Handoff grew out of moving real work between sessions and seeing what the next session was missing.
- A long summary could still omit the current blocker or fail to say which local changes belonged to the user.
- The [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) traces the move from a large conditional template to four sections built around continuing the work.
- Real-project histories are analyzed alongside results to identify failures and unnecessary context use.
- Targeted simulation and optimization workflows inform revisions. Changes are retained only when the required behavior survives.

## Compatibility

Any Agent Skills host that can read the named task sources. Optional read-only version-control inspection (git). No scripts, no network, no subagents. Developed for Codex and Claude Code; other hosts untested.

## Install

### Install this Skill

In a local Codex or Claude Code session, ask:

```text
Install this Agent Skill for all my projects from this exact package directory:
https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-handoff/tree/main/scoville-handoff
Preserve existing customizations and ask before overwriting conflicting files.
Report the installed location and whether the host discovers the Skill.
```

The agent needs source access and permission to write to its personal Skills
location. Manual fallback: [Codex Skills guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills)
or [Claude Code Skills guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills).

Install only the linked package for the focused option.

### Install the complete Scoville suite

Get the complete suite from the
[Scoville Suite monorepo](https://github.com/benjaminstelzer/scoville-suite).
Install its released Skill packages, not development templates.

## How to use

Request an explicit transfer and name any task sources the receiver will need:

```text
Use Scoville Handoff to transfer this active task to a new session. Read docs/plans/0001-migration.md and ADR-0002.md, include the current Git state, and return one copy-ready continuation prompt.
```

```text
Create a compact handoff for another agent. Preserve the objective, accepted decisions, dirty files, observed test evidence, current blocker, and next safe action. Do not continue the task.
```

```text
Use Scoville Handoff for the work completed in this session. Mark unverified commands and external state as unknown rather than inferring success.
```

Explicit `$scoville-handoff` invocation also works on hosts that support named
Skill invocation. The former `$compact-handoff` identifier is retired. Natural
requests such as “compact handoff” still activate this Skill.
